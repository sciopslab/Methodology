# 🦅 RT-STALKER Methodology
### Layered Architectural Latency Sterilization Protocol

**RT-STALKER** is the first verified methodology of the **SciOps** movement, aimed at achieving sub-microsecond determinism on standard ARM architectures.

## 🔬 Core Stages
1. **Vanilla Baseline:** Identifying the "Comb Effect" and scheduler chaos.
2. **Isolated Idle:** Reaching the Architectural Limit (The "Sterile Needle").
3. **Hardcore Stress:** Verifying "Noisy Neighbor" immunity under 100% load.

## 🏆 Current Record
* **Hardware:** Radxa Cube A7Z (Cortex-A76)
* **Latency:** **2 μs** (Avg) / **6 μs** (Stress)
* **Kernel:** 6.6-RT (Custom Sterilized Build)
